/**
 * Let's play the minesweeper game (Wikipedia, online game)!
 * <p>
 * You are given an m x n char matrix board representing the game board where:
 * <p>
 * 'M' represents an unrevealed mine,
 * <p>
 * 'E' represents an unrevealed empty square,
 * <p>
 * 'B' represents a revealed blank square that has no adjacent mines (i.e., above, below, left, right, and all 4 diagonals),
 * <p>
 * digit ('1' to '8') represents how many mines are adjacent to this revealed square, and
 * 'X' represents a revealed mine.
 * <p>
 * You are also given an integer array click where click = [clickr, clickc] represents the next click position among all the unrevealed squares ('M' or 'E').
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Return the board after revealing this position according to the following rules:
 * <p>
 * If a mine 'M' is revealed, then the game is over. You should change it to 'X'.
 * If an empty square 'E' with no adjacent mines is revealed, then change it to a revealed blank 'B' and all of its adjacent unrevealed squares should be revealed recursively.
 * If an empty square 'E' with at least one adjacent mine is revealed, then change it to a digit ('1' to '8') representing the number of adjacent mines.
 * Return the board when no more squares will be revealed.
 *
 *
 * <pre>
 * Example 1:
 *
 * <img src="../doc-files/529_1.jpeg" />
 *
 * Input: board = [["E","E","E","E","E"],["E","E","M","E","E"],["E","E","E","E","E"],["E","E","E","E","E"]], click = [3,0]
 * Output: [["B","1","E","1","B"],["B","1","M","1","B"],["B","1","1","1","B"],["B","B","B","B","B"]]
 * </pre>
 *
 * <pre>
 * Example 2:
 *
 * <img src="../doc-files/529_2.jpeg" />
 *
 * Input: board = [["B","1","E","1","B"],["B","1","M","1","B"],["B","1","1","1","B"],["B","B","B","B","B"]], click = [1,2]
 * Output: [["B","1","E","1","B"],["B","1","X","1","B"],["B","1","1","1","B"],["B","B","B","B","B"]]
 * </pre>
 *
 *
 * <pre>
 * Constraints:
 *
 * m == board.length
 * n == board[i].length
 * 1 <= m, n <= 50
 * board[i][j] is either 'M', 'E', 'B', or a digit from '1' to '8'.
 * click.length == 2
 * 0 <= clickr < m
 * 0 <= clickc < n
 * board[clickr][clickc] is either 'M' or 'E'.
 * </pre>
