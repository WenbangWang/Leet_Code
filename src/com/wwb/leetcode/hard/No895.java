/**
 * Design a stack-like data structure to push elements to the stack and pop the most frequent element from the stack.
 *
 * Implement the FreqStack class:
 *
 * FreqStack() constructs an empty frequency stack.
 * void push(int val) pushes an integer val onto the top of the stack.
 * int pop() removes and returns the most frequent element in the stack.
 * If there is a tie for the most frequent element, the element closest to the stack's top is removed and returned.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input
 * ["FreqStack", "push", "push", "push", "push", "push", "push", "pop", "pop", "pop", "pop"]
 * [[], [5], [7], [5], [7], [4], [5], [], [], [], []]
 * Output
 * [null, null, null, null, null, null, null, 5, 7, 5, 4]
 *
 * Explanation
 * FreqStack freqStack = new FreqStack();
 * freqStack.push(5); // The stack is [5]
 * freqStack.push(7); // The stack is [5,7]
 * freqStack.push(5); // The stack is [5,7,5]
 * freqStack.push(7); // The stack is [5,7,5,7]
 * freqStack.push(4); // The stack is [5,7,5,7,4]
 * freqStack.push(5); // The stack is [5,7,5,7,4,5]
 * freqStack.pop();   // return 5, as 5 is the most frequent. The stack becomes [5,7,5,7,4].
 * freqStack.pop();   // return 7, as 5 and 7 is the most frequent, but 7 is closest to the top. The stack becomes [5,7,5,4].
 * freqStack.pop();   // return 5, as 5 is the most frequent. The stack becomes [5,7,4].
 * freqStack.pop();   // return 4, as 4, 5 and 7 is the most frequent, but 4 is closest to the top. The stack becomes [5,7].
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 0 <= val <= 10^9
 * At most 2 * 10^4 calls will be made to push and pop.
 * It is guaranteed that there will be at least one element in the stack before calling pop.
