Perfect — this is exactly the right strategy for a **Non-Technical Culture Interview at Anthropic** (especially with Diego Iaconelli).

You’ll want to show that you:

* deeply *care* about the social dimensions of technology,
* think critically about *AI safety, alignment, and human systems*,
* and engage in dialogue — not just give polished monologues.

Below are **~10 strong culture-fit questions** Diego might ask, followed by **sample answers (oral, conversational)** and **follow-up questions you could ask him** that align with his anthropological, human-systems view.

---

## 🧭 1️⃣ How do you think about “responsibility” as an engineer building powerful systems?

**Your Answer (oral):**

> “I think responsibility shows up in the small decisions — what we measure, what defaults we set, who we optimize for.
> When I was working on Meta’s resource autoscaling service, we initially optimized purely for efficiency. It worked, but it created fairness issues — smaller jobs got starved out. We later added weighted priorities so each workload had a fair share.
> That experience taught me that responsibility isn’t just ‘do no harm’ — it’s *actively anticipating second-order effects* before they become systemic.”

**Follow-up Question (to Diego):**

> “I really like your framing of technology as a human system — how does Anthropic help engineers stay aware of those social consequences day-to-day?”

---

## 🧠 2️⃣ How do you personally think about AI alignment?

**Your Answer:**

> “To me, alignment means making sure the model continues to represent human intent — especially as it gets more capable.
> In distributed systems, we call it ‘drift control’ — over time, you add feedback loops, monitoring, and guardrails to keep behavior within bounds.
> I imagine alignment similarly: the feedback loop between human values and model behavior should never break.”

**Follow-up Question:**

> “I’m curious — how does Anthropic’s alignment work interact with social research? Are there anthropologists or sociologists involved in the process?”

## ⚖️ 3️⃣ Have you ever faced a trade-off between speed and safety? How did you handle it?

**Your Answer:**

> “All the time. When we did the Samza→Flink migration at LinkedIn, we had tight deadlines, but early versions had reliability gaps.
> We paused the rollout, improved observability, and built replay tooling before scaling. That decision saved weeks of firefighting later.
> So my philosophy is: *measure twice, scale once.*”

**Follow-up Question:**

> “I’m wondering — how does Anthropic balance that tension between rapid research progress and its Responsible Scaling Policy in practice?”

---

## 🔐 4️⃣ How do you think about privacy in the context of AI safety?

**Your Answer:**

> “I see privacy as an ingredient of safety.
> If people can’t trust that their data is handled safely, the system’s legitimacy erodes.
> When I worked on Flink’s job metadata system, we anonymized sensitive logs so engineers could debug safely without access to user data. That kind of discipline builds a foundation of trust.”

**Follow-up Question:**

> “Since you think a lot about human trust and technology, how does Anthropic approach data minimization or transparency as a cultural practice, not just a compliance item?”

---

## 🔄 5️⃣ How do you build systems that remain robust as they scale?

**Your Answer:**

> “I’ve learned that robustness comes from humility — assuming things *will* go wrong and designing feedback loops accordingly.
> We built self-healing workflows in Meta’s stream platform that automatically quarantined unhealthy jobs before they cascaded.
> I think AI systems need the same — mechanisms to gracefully handle uncertainty.”

**Follow-up Question:**

> “Does Anthropic take inspiration from distributed systems design in its AI reliability work — like circuit breakers or layered fail-safes?”

---

## 🌍 6️⃣ What role should cultural context play in AI deployment?

**Your Answer:**

> “A huge one. Models trained on global data can unintentionally flatten cultural nuances.
> For instance, even at Meta, we saw how one-size-fits-all engagement metrics ended up suppressing local expression.
> That’s why I love Anthropic’s emphasis on *cultural diversity* in AI — respecting local feedback loops rather than enforcing a global norm.”

**Follow-up Question:**

> “You’ve studied cultural adaptation of technology — I’d love to hear your take: how can AI strengthen rather than erode cultural diversity?”

---

## 🧩 7️⃣ How do you maintain clarity when designing complex systems?

**Your Answer:**

> “By constantly re-articulating the mental model to others — documentation, design reviews, and feedback.
> Complexity breeds misalignment if people’s mental models diverge.
> I think of it as ‘social debugging’ — talking through design until the system makes sense to everyone involved.”

**Follow-up Question:**

> “You’ve written about viewing technical systems as social systems — how does Anthropic embed that idea into team collaboration?”

---

## 💬 8️⃣ How do you handle disagreement on ethical or strategic issues?

**Your Answer:**

> “I try to surface disagreement early and make it explicit.
> In our team at LinkedIn, we used to do ‘ethics design reviews’ informally — basically just asking, ‘who could this change hurt?’
> That’s often where we found blind spots. Healthy disagreement, handled respectfully, is a safety mechanism.”

**Follow-up Question:**

> “How does Anthropic foster that kind of open ethical discussion internally — are there forums or working groups for it?”

---

## ⏱️ 9️⃣ How do you think about time in relation to technological change?

**Your Answer:**

> “I think we often underestimate the long tail of our decisions.
> The systems we build today might still be influencing data flows or models years later.
> So I like to build for *slow change*: modular designs, good documentation, and long-term auditability.”

**Follow-up Question:**

> “Given your research on time and technology — how do you think Anthropic balances long-term stewardship with short-term innovation cycles?”

---

## 🚀 10️⃣ What excites you most about working at Anthropic?

**Your Answer:**

> “I love that Anthropic pairs technical ambition with moral seriousness.
> The Responsible Scaling Policy, the Long-Term Benefit Trust — those aren’t afterthoughts; they’re built into how the company grows.
> And as someone who’s worked on critical infrastructure, that resonates — you don’t scale something unless you can control it safely.”

**Follow-up Question:**

> “How do you see Anthropic’s mission evolving as AI capabilities increase — do you think governance and safety will become even more cross-disciplinary?”

## 🗣️ Pro Tip: The Interview Tone to Aim For

* Reflective, not performative — you’re *thinking out loud*, not reciting.
* Connect system-level thinking (like observability, reliability) to *human-level outcomes* (like trust, fairness, understanding).
* Ask him follow-ups that show *curiosity about social dimensions*, not just tech ones.
