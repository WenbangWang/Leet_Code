Nice find — Diego Iaconelli’s background is *very human-centered*, blending anthropology, governance, and technical operations. Based on his bio + what I could dig up, here’s how you can **refine your culture-/behavior-questions** to resonate with his POV, plus some **questions you can ask him** in your non-technical culture interview.

---

## 🔍 What I picked up about Diego’s viewpoint & interests

From his bio / LinkedIn / CV:

* He trained as an anthropologist, which means he views tech through the lens of *culture, social systems, human context* rather than purely “system + code.” ([LinkedIn UK][1])
* At Anthropic, he works on “Endpoint Management and CPE (Customer Premise Equipment?) / CPE-adjacent systems / IT & Security / infrastructure for EMEA region” — so his technical domain is infra / endpoint / security / governance-ish. ([iaconelli.org][2])
* His writing / thinking explores “resonance patterns” (how global technology adoption is shaped by local culture), and how transformative tech (like AI) can either erode or strengthen cultural diversity. ([LinkedIn UK][1])
* In his CV (on iaconelli.org) he also speaks to coordinating security, enterprise-IT frameworks, automation (e.g. macOS packaging automation, enterprise endpoints), and governance *across geographies* (EMEA). ([iaconelli.org][2])

So he’s likely to value answers that:

* Treat engineering problems as also human or cultural systems problems
* Show awareness of governance, policy, regional impact (not just “global default”)
* Emphasize reliability, security, compliance / risk—not purely speed or novelty
* Appreciate balancing local vs global, or infrastructure plus “human implications”

## ✅ Interview Questions (for *you to answer*, tailored to his perspective)

Here are **culture-fit / non-technical style questions** Diego might ask (or that align well with his lens). Use them to prep your answers, phrased to show you understand his worldview.

1. **“Tell me about a time when you had to consider cultural / human impact — not just technical correctness — in a large engineering migration.”**
   → He could want you to talk about how a system change affected diverse user groups, error-reporting UX, or cross-organizational coordination.

2. **“How do you think infrastructure decisions (e.g. deployment, endpoint security, resource routing) can inadvertently erode trust or create inequity?”**
   → This tests whether you see infra work as neutral or whether you consider its social consequences.

3. **“When you roll out changes (migration, infrastructure updates, new controls), how do you balance global consistency vs regional/localism (e.g. compliance, local norms, different vendor constraints)?”**
   → His EMEA / endpoint governance background suggests he’ll care about regional variation.

4. **“Can you share an example of a project where you designed a system to measure / record key metrics not just for performance, but for long-term trust or safety (possibly over time)?”**
   → He explicitly mentions “measure and record time / timekeeping systems” in his interests: he might press about how you build observability / long-term monitoring for trust.

5. **“How do you think AI-infused tools (or future AI capabilities) could affect cultural or social diversity?”**
   → He’s thought about how “universal technologies undergo transformation through local cultural practices.” He’ll likely want someone who thinks about diversity & unintended cultural impact in AI systems, not just tokens.

6. **“Describe how you’d work with cross-disciplinary stakeholders (e.g. policy / compliance / security / local region leads) when rolling out changes to infrastructure that interface with AI / model-driven systems.”**
   → He may ask about collaboration beyond “tech team,” involving security / legal / local offices / compliance.

7. **“In your prior migration (e.g. Samza → Flink or Yarn → K8s), did you build any mechanism to surface long-term drift or deviation — not just performance regressions but trust or correctness regressions over time?”**
   → This ties your concrete work to his interests in “timekeeping,” measurement, monitoring.

| Question                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Why It Fits His Profile                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| “I saw from your CV that you have experience managing Endpoint / Security infrastructure for EMEA. How do regional compliance, cultural norms, or local vendor relationships shape how you design endpoint or security systems at Anthropic?”   | Speaks to his EMEA / regional & governance experience.                                                        |
| “When you build or manage endpoint-management / device-management tooling, do you consider how different user populations might use them differently — and if so, how do you gather feedback across those variances?”                           | Taps his anthropologist-by-training view of considering people in system design.                              |
| “You mentioned ‘resonance patterns’ in your bio — do you see analogous patterns in how AI safety policies are adopted across different regions? Has Anthropic navigated those kinds of local-culture ↔ global-policy tensions in your work?”    | Directly reflects his anthropological framing + governance / policy interest.                                 |
| “How does the technical team collaborate with policy or trust & safety groups when you're building infrastructure (endpoints / security)? For example, is there a feedback loop where security / governance concerns influence design earlier?” | Shows interest in cross-functional collaboration.                                                             |
| “Could you share an example of an endpoint or internal governance system you helped design where the social or cultural impact was considered as early as the architecture?”                                                                    | Gives him a chance to talk about a real project that mixes tech + “human systems.”                            |
| “How do you think timing / time-recording / observability (your interest in time systems) plays into AI safety or trust at Anthropic? Do you have internal tools for tracking long-term drift of safety-relevant metrics over months / years?”  | References his “timekeeping” fascination, connects to your interest in monitoring & long-term safety.         |
| “What’s one thing someone in your role sees as a blind spot when thinking about infrastructure + cultural / policy risk — and how could a software engineer help mitigate that?”                                                                | A smart closing question that invites candidness and shows you want to contribute to that very risk boundary. |

Excellent. Here’s your **personalized “Diego Iaconelli – Non-Technical Culture Interview Cheat Sheet”** — five polished questions crafted for *you*, based on your résumé (infra / control plane / large-scale systems) and **Diego’s anthropological + governance-focused lens**.

Each one subtly highlights your mindset (safety, observability, cross-cultural sensitivity) while inviting him to speak about what he values.

---

## 🧭 **1. “I noticed you describe technology as a human system as much as a technical one. How does that perspective influence how Anthropic engineers make day-to-day infrastructure or deployment decisions?”**

🎯 *Why this works:*

* Signals respect for his anthropological worldview.
* Bridges your “control plane” experience (where human & automated decisions meet) with his interest in governance and human-system design.

📎 *Possible follow-up:*

> “In my past work on job orchestration systems, we treated the control plane as a socio-technical layer—balancing automation with clear human override paths. I’d love to know how Anthropic builds that balance into its systems.”

---

## 🧩 **2. “Your writing on ‘resonance patterns’ suggests you think about how global technologies adapt to local contexts. Does Anthropic see similar regional or cultural variation in how AI safety practices are implemented or understood?”**

🎯 *Why it works:*

* References his published ideas (“resonance patterns”).
* Shows you think about safety not as a static rulebook but as a living, culturally mediated process.

📎 *Follow-up:*

> “In distributed data infra, we saw that even identical pipelines behave differently across environments. I imagine AI governance might experience that same ‘local translation’—I’d love to hear how Anthropic navigates that.”

---

## 🧠 **3. “From an anthropological lens, how does Anthropic measure whether its internal culture actually reinforces long-term safety values rather than eroding them under delivery pressure?”**

🎯 *Why it works:*

* Shows deep awareness of *Mission 7: strong governance* and *Mission 6: long-term benefit*.
* Invites him to talk about how culture is measured — tying to his fascination with “systems that record time and behavior.”

📎 *Follow-up:*

> “In infra engineering, we track system drift over time; I’m curious what the cultural equivalent of that looks like at Anthropic.”

---

## ⚖️ **4. “When you think about endpoint management and infrastructure, where do you see the human or cultural risks that engineers often overlook?”**

🎯 *Why it works:*

* Brings him into his domain expertise (Endpoint / CPE / governance).
* Gives you a natural segue to mention reliability, access control, or automation you’ve led (e.g. resource quotas, safety gates).

📎 *Follow-up:*

> “I’ve seen automation bias cause people to over-trust orchestration results—almost like an organizational blind spot. Do you see parallels in how people interact with safety or governance tools?”

---

## 🕰 **5. “You’ve written about the social phenomenon of timekeeping. If we extend that metaphor to AI, what kinds of ‘temporal awareness’ do you think matter—like tracking the evolution of models or decisions over long horizons?”**

🎯 *Why it works:*

* Directly touches his niche passion (time systems).
* Lets you segue into your experience building continuous monitoring and anomaly-detection frameworks.

📎 *Follow-up:*

> “In my stream-processing work we built replay mechanisms to examine historical state transitions—almost a time-record of behavior. I wonder how Anthropic thinks about maintaining that kind of longitudinal trace for models.”
