For the coding interview, we will be doing coding in a live runtime environment in Python (v3.10). We will be using CodeSignal by default for your interview; to ensure a smooth start, we recommend you take a quick look at CodeSignal’s preparation resources. We're interested in seeing you interact in a real work environment, so your interviews may be more open-ended than a standard technical problems, and you should feel empowered to engage with your interviewer and ask questions. This won’t require any specialized knowledge or prep beyond general familiarity with reading and writing Python code. Note that use of AI tools during this interview is not permitted, however Google, Stack Overflow, etc. is allowed. We may ask you to share your screen in Google Meet. People often run into browser permission issues, so we recommend preparing before the interview by starting a google meet with yourself and sharing the screen as a test.
