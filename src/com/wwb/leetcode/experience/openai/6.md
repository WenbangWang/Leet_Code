Tree related
1) count machines in a tree
   Design a method to count the total number of machines in a tree where each node represents a machine. Machines can only communicate
   with their parent and child nodes using a provided interface with sendAsyncMessage() and receiveMessage() functions. Implement the
   receiveMessage method to handle 'count' messages by sending the same message to child nodes and ‘response’ messages by recording the
   count number from each child, summing them up, and returning the sum to the parent node. Consider special cases such as when the node is a root or a leaf.


2) return a tree topology
   Extend the feature from the previous question to not only count the machines but also return the entire tree's topology. Define two new
   message types, 'topology' and 'topologyResponse’, and ensure the response includes the actual data needed to be sent back. Implement the
   logic to handle these messages similarly to the 'count' and 'countResponse' messages from the first question.


3) You are given a tree-like class where each node can have 1 to 3 guides. The requirement is that a node must be the largest value in each
   subtree. However, the class is not returning the correct values. Identify and debug the issue in the class implementation.


Largest Sub-Grid
Given a 2D array, find the maximum size of a square sub-grid such that all sub-grids of this size must have a sub-grid sum less than or equal to a given maxsum.


Web Crawler
Implement a web crawler that can actually run and, given a URL, return a list of all links connected to that page. Solve the problem using
DFS/BFS search. For the second part, modify the web crawler to use multi-threading to address the issue of |O-blocking. The expectation is to use Python for this task.


implement a 'cd' Command
Implement a 'cd' command for the Linux system. Your solution should handle various special cases such as '../A/B/'", './A/', '../A/B/../', etc., by
performing string processing to simplify the path. Discuss how you would handle these cases and any potential string processing or data
structures you would use to implement the command.


Write a cd() method that takes two inputs: the current directory and a relative destination. The output should be the final path, similar to how
the 'cd' command works in a terminal followed by 'pwd'. Follow-up questions include: 1) Add support for the '~' symbol, which represents the
user's home directory. 2) Add support for symbolic links, assuming there is a map of symbolic link paths and their respective real paths.


Describe how you would implement the 'cd' command used in shell environments. Discuss how the Linux file system tree is implemented,
including concepts such as inodes.


Shortest Path to Visit All Points on a Grid
In an m*n grid, where each grid point is either '.', '#' or '*', find the shortest path that visits all '*' points. Movement is allowed up, down, left, or
right, and entry into ‘#' points is not allowed. The path can start at any non-'#' grid point and can pass through non-'#' grid points any number
of times. The output should be an array of coordinates (xi, yi) representing the path, or an empty array if no such path exists.


Implement Spreadsheet with Cells


Implement a spreadsheet with cells that can either have a direct value or be dependent on other cells. The first question is straightforward and
can be solved using DFS to traverse the cells. The second question asks for a more efficient search method. One approach is to use an
additional cache to store values, along with a parent map. However, it might be possible to store the information directly in the Cell class.
Consider the provided Cell and Spreadsheet class structures and discuss possible solutions for efficient cell value retrieval and updates.


Design a spreadsheet system with a class Cell that can represent an integer value or the sum of two other cells. Implement two functions,
getCell() and setCellValue(). For example, if Cell A has a value of 6, Cell B has a value of 7, and Cell C is the sum of A and B (13), updating Cell
A to 2 should automatically update Cell C to 9. Provide test cases to verify your solution.


In a spreadsheet application, a cell can contain an integer or a formula like 'A1 + B1’. Initially, you can use a simple depth-first search (DFS) for
the evaluation. How would you optimize the evaluation process, especially considering multiple requests and their optimization?


Implement a basic Depth-First Search (DFS) for a spreadsheet application, using Python and the 'networkx' package. Then, optimize the
implementation with caching, particularly focusing on how to find outdated downstream nodes when a node is changed.


Implement a Spreadsheet API with functions getCell and setCell. The setCell function should be able to depend on other cells or provide an
independent value, for example, setCell('A', 'B+C') or setCell('A', 100). Start with a brute force solution and then optimize it.


Linear Algebra
Discuss various methods for handling matrix multiplication in a multithreading environment and explain how to aggregate the results. What are


the pros and cons of these methods in practice?


lmplement a Basic LRU Cache
Design and implement a basic Least Recently Used (LRU) cache with the following methods: void addKey(string key) int getCountForKey(string
key) Additionally, maintain a max heap to record all entries with a specific priority. Discuss how you would handle changes in priority.


Refactor Chatbot Service Code
You are given a codebase for a chat service that supports various bots triggered by different keywords, such as ‘away’, 'meet', 'taco count',
etc. Your task is to refactor the code to make it easier to support additional functionalities. Propose an interface called 'IBotService' with at
least two APIs: 'shouldActive' returning a boolean, and ‘execute’ returning a string. Describe how you would convert the existing bot logic into
corresponding classes and register them within the chat room. When a new message arrives, explain how you would iterate through all
registered bots, check if they are active, and if so, execute them. Also, address the challenge of handling a bot that requires global state.


Toy language
You have a toy language grammar with primitives, tuples, generics, and functions
Primitives: char, int, float
Generices: uppercase alpha with number e.g. T1, T2 …
Tuples list of Primitives or Generic or Tuple: [ int, T1, char ]
With tuple nested [int, char, [ int, T1] ]
Implement Node class to represent Primitives & Tuples (empty class provided)
Constructor input is value (optional str) and children (optional list of Node)
Value passed if primitive
children passed if tuple
Functions have params and return like this: [int; [int, T1]; T2] -> [char, T2, [float, float]]
Param is list of Node
Return is a tuple
Implement Function class to represent functions (empty class provided)
Constructor takes params (list of Node) and return (Node)
P1: Implement to_str for Function & Node
P2: Implement infer_return(function, param) -> return
Given function & param values like, return actual return type after substituting out generics (T1, T2 etc)
Must raise error if there is type mismatch or conflict
Example
Func: [T1, T2, int, T1] -> [T1, T2]
Params: [int, char, int, int]
Should return [int, char]
If params was [int, int, int, int] then raise error for type mismatch (int vs char)
If params was [int, int, int, char] then raise error for type conflict
