Design a CI/CD job scheduler
Design a Cl/CD job scheduler that utilizes tech such as k8s and docker. Discuss how you would
approach the design and the key components involved


Design a system for a multi-tenant Cl/CD workflow triggered by a git push. The system should analyze the git push to obtain the GitHub
repository ID using an internal API service. The workflow configuration is stored in the GitHub repository. After the workflow is created, it
should schedule a sequence of jobs defined in the config file. Additionally, design a front-end UI to display the progress of the workflow after
it has been created.


In-memory DB design
Design an in-memory database similar to the one described in LeetCode's 'Design SQL' problem. The interview question likely consists of four
parts, but only two parts were completed due to time constraints.


Describe how you would implement an in-memory database. Discuss the data structures you would use, how you would handle concurrency,
and what algorithms might be involved in ensuring efficient operations.


Design an in-memory database with the following requirements: - The database should support efficient querying. — Provide a solution for

quick querying. In the follow-up, discuss how to use a reverted index for this purpose.


explain how you would address server bottlenecks if server resources are limited and the dataset is too large to be uploaded in memory.
Provide a strategy for keeping the most recently hit data sections in memory and preloading the most frequent datasets in memory.


Design a Webhook System
Design a web hook delivery system. The details of what was expected in the design were not provided, but it can be inferred that the system
should handle the delivery of web hooks efficiently.


Design a webhook system focusing on how to handle failures, various retry scenarios, scaling the system, and validating that the request is
sent to the correct users. The design should not focus on the database, and all information required to request an external URL should be
provided in the payload.


Design a webhook system. Follow the approach outlined in the provided resource (https://pyemma.github.io/How-to—Design—Webhook/).


Point of Interest (POI) System Design
Design a system that manages points of interest (POI) for a mapping application. Explain how you would store and retrieve POI data, scale the
system for high traffic, and ensure data consistency and integrity.


How would you design a system to query the nearest 'k' points of interest (POIs)? Explain in detail your approach, including the use of geohash
and indexing to record each block's POls. Address edge cases by querying adjacent nodes. Additionally, discuss scaling strategies such as
sharding and caching.


In a design interview focused on Points of Interest (POI), you were asked about how to build an index and how to shard this index. Please
describe your approach to indexing POls and your strategy for sharding the index to ensure efficient data retrieval and scalability.


Design a system for a review site similar to AZLAi#. Focus on the basics of designing a scalable application without the need to take user
feedback into consideration. Specifically, discuss how to update restaurant data efficiently.


Prepare a system design for a Point of Interest (POI) service similar to those used by Yelp or Uber. You will be informed about this topic by HR
during preparation. Focus on designing a robust and scalable system.


Design a 'get_poi' (point of interest) feature for a location-based service like Foursquare. Provide design approaches using geohash and
quadtree, and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.


you might be asked to design a QuadTree that can efficiently find the exactly nearest N points to a given point.


Discuss how you would approach this problem, including any initial methods you might consider and how you would iterate upon them to find a
better solution.
