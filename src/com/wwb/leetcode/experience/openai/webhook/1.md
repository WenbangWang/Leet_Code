Design a Webhook System
Design a web hook delivery system. The details of what was expected in the design were not provided, but it can be inferred that the system
should handle the delivery of web hooks efficiently.


Design a webhook system focusing on how to handle failures, various retry scenarios, scaling the system, and validating that the request is
sent to the correct users. The design should not focus on the database, and all information required to request an external URL should be
provided in the payload.
