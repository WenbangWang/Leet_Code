Toy language:
You have a toy language grammar with primitives, tuples, generics, and functions
Primitives: char, int, float
Generices: uppercase alpha with number e.g. T1, T2 …
Tuples list of Primitives or Generic or Tuple: [ int, T1, char ] 
With tuple nested [int, char, [ int, T1] ]
Implement Node class to represent Primitives & Tuples (empty class provided)
Constructor input is value (optional str) and children (optional list of Node)
Value passed if primitive
children passed if tuple 
Functions have params and return like this: [int; [int, T1]; T2] -> [char, T2, [float, float]]
Param is list of Node
Return is a tuple
Implement Function class to represent functions (empty class provided)
Constructor takes params (list of Node) and return (Node)
P1: Implement to_str for Function & Node
P2: Implement infer_return(function, param) -> return
Given function & param values like, return actual return type after substituting out generics (T1, T2 etc)
Must raise error if there is type mismatch or conflict
Example
Func: [T1, T2, int, T1] -> [T1, T2]
Params: [int, char, int, int]
Should return [int, char]
If params was [int, int, int, int] then raise error for type mismatch (int vs char)
If params was [int, int, int, char] then raise error for type conflict
