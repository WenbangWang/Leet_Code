/**
 * Given an Iterator class interface with methods: next() and hasNext(),
 * design and implement a PeekingIterator that support the peek() operation --
 * it essentially peek() at the element that will be returned by the next call to next().
 *
 * Here is an example. Assume that the iterator is initialized to the beginning of the list: [1, 2, 3].
 *
 * Call next() gets you 1, the first element in the list.
 *
 * Now you call peek() and it returns 2, the next element. Calling next() after that still return 2.
 *
 * You call next() the final time and it returns 3, the last element. Calling hasNext() after that should return false.
 *
 * Follow up: How would you extend your design to be generic and work with all types, not just integer?
